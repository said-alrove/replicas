# replicas
In this repository I'll upload (by adding submodules to them) the different attemps of replicas of a variety of websites that I try to do.

> **Disclaimer:** I'm starting to learn how to use **Git/Github** correctly, therefore there'll be plenty of pull requests, commits and other stuff as tests in this repository, however, *this won't represent my way of working forever*, I'll learn more things along the way as always :D!.
